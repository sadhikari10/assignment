    <h1><i>What is Web Design?</i></h1>
    <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of 
        <br> website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, 
        <br> since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p>
