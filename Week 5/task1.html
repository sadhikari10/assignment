If the security breach at the Babha Atomic <br>Research Center last year by the hacker group milworm didn't convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka <br>jdavis_a, a resident of <a href="www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483" style="color:blue;">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</a> homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e- <br>mail in your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the Net <br>for more such accounts! <br>
    Surprised? Or scared?

<p>(a-b)<sup>2</sup>= a<sup>2</sup>- 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></p>

<font>Whatever it is, jdevis_4 claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords that he has got exactly 108 working passwords (and growing <br>daily),<i>36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet and 23 online passwords.</i> </font>
